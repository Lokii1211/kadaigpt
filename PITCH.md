## 📋 THE PROBLEM

### India's Retail Reality

| Statistic | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **12+ Million** Kirana stores | 88% of India's retail |
| **Only 3%** are tech-enabled | Massive opportunity |
| **60%** struggle with technology | Need simple solutions |
| **₹50,000/year** lost to billing errors | Manual processes hurt |
| **30%** time wasted on ledgers | Could be selling instead |
| **Poor internet** in Tier-2/3 cities | Offline capability needed |

### Current Pain Points

1. **📝 Manual Billing**: 2-3 minutes per customer → Long queues → Lost sales
2. **📄 Handwritten Bills**: Hard to digitize → Poor records → GST compliance issues
3. **🧾 GST Confusion**: Complex calculations → Errors → Penalties
4. **📶 Internet Dependency**: Outages = No billing = Lost revenue
5. **💳 Credit (Khata) Chaos**: Notebook entries → Disputes → Bad debts
6. **📊 Zero Analytics**: No insights → Poor inventory → Wastage

### Who Suffers?

- **Shop Owners**: Work 14+ hours, low margins, no data
- **Customers**: Long waits, billing errors, no digital receipts
- **Suppliers**: Delayed payments, no visibility
- **Government**: GST evasion, informal economy
